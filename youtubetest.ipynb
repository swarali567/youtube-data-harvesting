In today’s video, I am taking a road trip to NYC...ALONE! I had so much footage from this 4-day trip that I decided to split it into 2 vlogs, so this is part 1. In this vlog, I'm driving into the city, arriving at my ~beautiful~ hotel, doing some Whole Foods shopping, giving you a hotel room tour, and just getting settled in & ready for the rest of the week. Stay tuned for part 2 next week :)\\nThank you so much for watching! xoxo, Han\\n\\nHelp me to translate this video into your language! ☞ http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?c=UCT9y7nOBdqfWuaZJ_x9mPkA&tab=2\\n\\n☞ MUSIC USED:\\nMusic by ninjoi. - Thank You - https://thmatc.co/?l=A07FA5D6 \\nBetter Late Than Never Baby by Jesse Lawrence & Easton\\nMusic by Dylan Rockoff & Max Wells - Highlight Reel - https://thmatc.co/?l=63E54D0F \\nMusic by Lukey - Darling - https://thmatc.co/?l=747C87B5 \\nStone Cookies by Dusty Decks\\n9th Power by Henyao\\nMusic by HOAX - Western Medicine - https://thmatc.co/?l=A8F44AE0 \\nMusic by Mr. Chase - Wild Cherry - https://thmatc.co/?l=4AF031FE  \\n\\n☞ SOCIALS:\\nInstagram @hannahemaute\\nTwitter @hannahemaute\\nTikTok: hannahemaute\\nPinterest: hannahemaute\\n\\n☞ EMAIL:\\nFor business inquiries only plz\\nhannahelise@select.co\\n\\n☞ FAQs:\\nWhat camera do you use?

In today’s video I am undertaking a project that I've wanted to do for AWHILE: I am creating a proper office space in my room!!! With the help of my family, I renovated the space that once occupied my (old) desk, built new furniture, and turned the space into an office that is organized, professional and inspiring. I could not be happier with how this turned out. MASSIVE thank you to my dad who did all the demo, installed my new floor, AND built my new desk.

I'm about to be done my junior year, which is insane, and I felt like looking back on my experience thus far and sharing how it was different from what I thought it'd be. Also, with college tours canceled and school potentially being online in the fall, incoming and prospective students probably have a lot of questions that they'd typically ask a tour guide or another student.

(learned this from my therapist btw) When I ask myself why I’m feeling resistance and the response is “I don’t want to do the task” I then ask myself if I’m “willing to” and most of the time the answer is yes! Unfortunately most things in life I don’t want to do lol but I’m more than willing to do it if it aligns with my values and creating a life I want to live! Similarly but different my friend likes to say “it’s not a lack of motivation it’s a lack of momentum.” Hope you are able to get out of your rut soon &lt;3',\n",

I legit have had a walking pad forever and just looked at it and felt guilty because I wasn&#39;t using it -- I didn&#39;t have the leggings, didn&#39;t have enough workout wear, need to make sure other chores are done first, etc.  When I figured out that I was thinking TOO MUCH about it, I just got on the walking pad with crocs and pajamas shorts and JUST WALKED. A concept, lol. Overthinking is such an action-killer.',\n",

This being my first one back was so needed because i&#39;ve been feeling stuck myself. I turn 24 in a few days and i feel so unaccomplished in life. There&#39;s so many reasons that I feel that way, however, hearing you say that it&#39;s normal is so validating becuase a majority of my friends are in their late 20&#39;s to early 30&#39;s given that very few people my age work at my job and that&#39;s really the only place i&#39;ve found to socialize. Being that my friends are older than me and are more established than i am starts to make me feel so behind in life and stuck because i don&#39;t know what i really want to do in my life/ what direction i&#39;m going in. Sorry if this is grammatically horrendous, I&#39;m running on just a few hours of sleep and no caffeine yet.',\n",

My ex was always what exercise are we going to do today, everyone day, it drove me nuts. I have a sister that is the same way and it drives me nuts.

       "  'Comment_Text': 'Regarding going to the gym, try to set up a really cool habit that you only do after you&#39;re done with your gym work out. I usually like to run every day, but don&#39;t. But i like to run when I get to eat the protein pack yogurt when I get home after the run. So if you set something up after your gym workout to look forward to, you find yourself pushing yourself to get there. Because you really want what is after. and I totally agree with the phone anxiety. I hate talking on the phone I would rather text but also too note that health insurances I&#39;ve noticed when you do talk to them on the phone they are incredibly nice.  And supportive way more than normal. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re calling the phone company and you have a rude person trying to make sure you don&#39;t cancel your phone service type of vibe so. Try that too if that helps. PS love your videos. You&#39;re the best! ❤',\n",

And there were so many times i just wanted to give up and stop but like i was like no, if nesta could walk like 5 mountains so exhausted, i could do it too. And i did ! The soles of my socks were literally non existant when i got home. But man, i really needed that hike. I was goin through alot of self doubt and some hard decisions.',\n",

       "  'Comment_Text': 'Tell me why I cried while watching this 🥺😭 Hannah I am so proud of you! You have stepped so much out of your comfort zone in 2023 and conquered some of your fears. You did the damn thing and what a beautiful life you have created for yourself. I hope to have the courage to do the same this year as a fellow introvert who also enjoys the comfort of their home and prefers being alone (with my 2 dogs of course 🐶❤). I thoroughly enjoy your YouTube videos and podcast episodes, I’ve been following you since you were in college (I was also in college struggling and your videos made me feel less alone) and have never related more to another YouTuber. You truly inspire me, make me feel less alone, and honestly feel like a friend that I’ve never met lol Thank you for being you, for being vulnerable, for sharing the good and the bad, for showing what life could be like outside your comfort zone, and for proving how empowering it can be to do things on your own for yourself. I can’t wait to see what 2024 has in store for you! <br><br>Sincerely, <br>Your long time silent follower 🤎',\n",
